                        Commondore Krux's bottom half lays motionless infront of you. You look up at Xeleth as he argues with his sister.
                        You notice something strange about him...

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt come from Wandell for the past few days. Wandell 
                        has seemed a little off. He had been doing things that he normally doesn't do. At the moment he is normal. But before
                        there was something different about him. Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger aboutt Xeleth. He is listening
                        to his sister, but he keeps looking back. As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound
                        coming from him. He is either going crazy or someone we can not see is talking to him.

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt aboard the Fred's Fish Fry. You're not completely
                        sure where its emanating from but you know for sure its been on the Fish Fry since you boarded the ship.
                        Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger about Xeleth. He is listening
                        to his sister, but he keeps looking back. As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound
                        coming from him. He is either going crazy or someone we can not see is talking to him.
