                        Commondore Krux's bottom half lays motionless infront of you. You look up at Xeleth as he argues with his sister.
                        You notice something strange about him...

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt come from Wandell for the past few days. Wandell 
                        has seemed a little off. He had been doing things that he normally doesn't do. At the moment he is normal. But before
                        there was something different about him. Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger aboutt Xeleth. He is listening
                        to his sister, but he keeps looking back. As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound
                        coming from him. He is either going crazy or someone we can not see is talking to him.

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt aboard the Fred's Fish Fry. You're not completely
                        sure where its emanating from but you know for sure its been on the Fish Fry since you boarded the ship.
                        Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger about Xeleth. He is listening
                        to his sister, but he keeps looking back. As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound
                        coming from him. He is either going crazy or someone we can not see is talking to him.

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt aboard the Fred's Fish Fry. Now that you think of it,
                        its a power you've felt emanating from Wandell. You no longer feel the power coming from him but it was definitely there for a 
                        while. Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger about Xeleth. He is listening to his sister, but he keeps looking back.
                         As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound coming from him. He is either going crazy

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt aboard the Fred's Fish Fry. Recently, you've felt it emanating 
                        from Wandell. But you're definitely sure it comes from Barrabbas. This feeling isn't prominent. It's very subtle. Almost like it was being
                        masked. Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger about Xeleth. He is listening to his sister, but he keeps looking back.
                         As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound
                        coming from him. He is either going crazy or someone we can not see is talking to him.
