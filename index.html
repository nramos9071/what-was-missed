                        You notice something strange about him...

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt come from Wandell for the past few days. Wandell 
                        has seemed a little off. He had been doing things that he normally doesn't do. At the moment he is normal. But before
                        there was something different about him. Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger aboutt Xeleth. He is listening
                        to his sister, but he keeps looking back. As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound
                        coming from him. He is either going crazy or someone we can not see is talking to him.

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt aboard the Fred's Fish Fry. You're not completely
                        sure where its emanating from but you know for sure its been on the Fish Fry since you boarded the ship.
                        Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger about Xeleth. He is listening
                        to his sister, but he keeps looking back. As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound
                        coming from him. He is either going crazy or someone we can not see is talking to him.

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt aboard the Fred's Fish Fry. Now that you think of it,
                        its a power you've felt emanating from Wandell. You no longer feel the power coming from him but it was definitely there for a 
                        while. Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger about Xeleth. He is listening to his sister, but he keeps looking back.
                         As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound coming from him. He is either going crazy

                        You feel something emanating from Xeleth. Its a feeling you have felt aboard the Fred's Fish Fry. Recently, you've felt it emanating 
                        from Wandell. But you're definitely sure it comes from Barrabbas. This feeling isn't prominent. It's very subtle. Almost like it was being
                        masked. Then you notice Xeleth something even stranger about Xeleth. He is listening to his sister, but he keeps looking back.
                         As if he is listening to someone else. But there doesn't seem to be any other sound
                        coming from him. He is either going crazy or someone we can not see is talking to him.

                            Your party is discussing next steps. You aren't sure how the next battle will go. You're listening to what to the plans when
                            you notice that Vocath is staring at you. It seems like he has something to say to you. He walks up to you and says, "Thank you
                            for telling me what you did. I definitely deserved being yelled at. I just have a lot of emotions right now." Vocath begins to tear 
                            up.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            He continues, "Xeleth took my poor Sol at a very young age. I heard rumors of how horrible he was to Sol. I raised Sol as a baby. 
                            He looks vicious and he did something extremely horrible. But he's really a good dragon. He doesn't deserve the life he is living."
                            Vocath pulls something out from his pocket. It is a small fabric dragon doll. He squeezes the doll and a sharp squeak rings out from
                            the doll. "This was his favorite toy...when he was a baby. I don't know if he'll remember it, but maybe if you show it to him maybe
                            you could snap him out of whatever brainwashing my baby has been put through". Vocath hands you the doll.

                            "Thats fine." Vocath begins to tear up even more. "I promise you he is a good dragon. He doesn't deserve the life he
                            is living." Vocath walks away from you with his head down.
